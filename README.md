# Pyraminx Solution Progress
## Method: [Layer by Layer, tip first](https://ruwix.com/twisty-puzzles/pyraminx-triangle-rubiks-cube/)
I start by solving the corners. Then I make the triangles adjacent to the corners match eachother on every side. Then I get the "tip" (uppre 2 layers) solved using 2 formulas. Then, if thhe pyraminx is not solved yet I look if it is necessary to cycle the three possibly unsolved triangles in the bottom using one of 2 more formulas that I know. Then, if the pyraminx is still not solved, I have to flip 2, 4, or 6 paired edges using one formula.
